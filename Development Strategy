Development Strategy:

For each subsystem:
    Write core logic in C
    Create simple test harness
    Add hardware abstraction layer
    Implement real hardware drivers
    Add to web simulator last

Core Systems Development

Focus on the essential embedded systems first:

- Audio playback pipeline
- Basic UI state machine
- Storage management


Use simpler testing approach (unit tests in C)

Hardware Integration

Get basic hardware working with minimal feature set:

DAC configuration
Click wheel input
Display output


Focus on driver development

Web Simulator

    Create a C API that wraps your core logic
    Use Emscripten to expose just these APIs to JavaScript
    Build React simulator against this API


Priority Order for Implementation:
Audio System

    DAC driver
    Audio buffer management
    Basic playback controls


Storage System

    File system implementation
    Music database

UI System

    Menu navigation
    Click wheel input
    Display output
