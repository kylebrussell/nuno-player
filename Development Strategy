Development Strategy:

For each subsystem:
    Write core logic in C
    Create simple test harness
    Add hardware abstraction layer
    Implement real hardware drivers

Core Systems Development

Focus on the essential embedded systems first:

- Audio playback pipeline
- Basic UI state machine
- Storage management


Use simpler testing approach (unit tests in C)

Hardware Integration

Get basic hardware working with minimal feature set:

Audio codec configuration (I2S + I2C control)
Trackpad + click input
Display output


Focus on driver development

Priority Order for Implementation:
Audio System

    Codec driver (WM8960 or equivalent)
    Audio buffer management
    Basic playback controls


Storage System

    File system implementation
    Music database

UI System

    Menu navigation
    Trackpad input (tap zones + scroll)
    Display output
