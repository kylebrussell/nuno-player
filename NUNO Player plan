NUNO Player

A premium modern replica of the iPod mini from 2004. Keeps the classic Click Wheel UI, monochrome display, and focus on music playback, but delivers far more of the original device’s intended value by building around modern components.

Built in 2025, a cheap microcontroller with 20 years of improvements to power management features can deliver:
an even smoother Click Wheel scrolling UI, faster transitions between menus, and 1,000x+  larger audio libraries
2-5x battery life on lossy audio + standby
Lossless FLAC audio playback

Would aim to appeal to the Apple nostalgic techies who yearn for the days when devices were unique and beautiful and they spent less time doom scrolling on their smartphone. Willing to pay a premium for a device that satisfies that nostalgia while making real advances with the technology — see Analogue Pocket, ModRetro.

Battery Exploration

The original iPod mini used a 3.7V Li-ion battery rated at approximately 630mAh. 
For a modern device in 2025 using the same aluminum chassis dimensions (3.6 x 2.0 x 0.5 inches / 91.44 x 50.8 x 12.7mm):
Battery Technology Improvements:
Modern Li-ion cells have roughly 2-2.5x the energy density compared to 2004
Better packaging efficiency
More sophisticated protection circuits that take less space
Space Optimization:
Modern PCBs can be more densely packed
Components are generally smaller
Multi-layer PCB technology is better
We could reasonably fit a 1500-1800mAh battery while maintaining the original form factor. This assumes:
Main PCB taking ~30-35% of internal volume
Battery taking ~45-50% of internal volume
Remaining space for display, click wheel, connectors, and structural elements
