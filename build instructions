# Simulator Build Instructions

1. Install prerequisites (macOS examples):
   - `brew install cmake`
   - `brew install sdl2`
2. Configure the project in a fresh build directory:
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF
   ```
3. Build and run the simulator target:
   ```bash
   cmake --build build --target nuno-sim
   ./build/nuno-sim
   ```

Controls: drag the click wheel ring to scroll, tap the wheel segments (`MENU`, `<<`, `>>`, `PLAY/PAUSE`) or center button with the mouse, use arrow keys (`j`/`k`), mouse wheel, `Enter`, `Backspace`/`Esc`, and `Space` as keyboard shortcuts.
